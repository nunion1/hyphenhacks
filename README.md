# hyphenhacks
This is the website that Theo VanderMarck Jacob Shaul, Kai Denmark, Siddharth Chibber, and Lazlo Martinez created for the 2023 Hyphen Hacks 12 hour hackathon.
The theme of the hackathon was bridges, and we decided to create a platform with a Tinder-like UI to connect tutors with interested students. One can register themself as tutor on the website, and students can swipe right or left on tutors presented to them. When a student swipes right on a tutor, their contact information is added to the page at the "View My Matches" link below the tutor cards. 

This project uses HTML, JS and CSS, with a seperate glitch node.js server connecting to a MongoDB cluster.
